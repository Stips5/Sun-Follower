# Sun-Follower

Light follower made like shield for Arduino Uno, using 2 servos for positioning solar head with solar panel and 4 light resistors. Its made so that Arduino could be removed and available for other purposes. All parts except Arduino and other components are designed by me in CAD tools (AutoCad, BricsCAD), sliced with CURA and printed on Ultramaker2. 
Ligth follower has two modes of work, manual and automatic, switching between modes is done using switch botton, there are two leds representing each working mode.

Light follower is connected to PC using USB cable for power supply and data transmittion between Arduino and Visualisation program written in Java using jSerialComm for data bidirectional communication, swing and jfreeChart for drawing graphs which visualise voltages of resistors, solar panel and angles of servo motors.
